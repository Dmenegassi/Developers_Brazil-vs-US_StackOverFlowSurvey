### Motivation:
- The main goal of this project is compare some aspects between a developed country and an emergin one. In this case we are going to analyse the US and Brazil about some aspects and see if there is huge differences.

### Summary of results

#### All analysis were made in relative terms 

#### _What's the participation of each country in the survey?_
- The first observation was the participation of each country in the survey. Brazil represent 6,7% of the United States participation. Obviouly the size of each economy reflect in into the labor market and in estructural diffenreces between them

#### _How is the Emplyment Status of each country?_  
- The next point of interest was the labor market. In US 76%, 6,7% and 5,2% were the participations of Employed full-tim, self-employed,  and Employed part-time. While in Brazil it were 66%, 14%  8,1% respectively. The highlight was to the second position. Brazil has more than double of self employed than US in relative terms.

#### _How the programers learn in these two countries?_

- The Labor market dynamics of each one is also seen by analysing Education Types. As the comparison indicates, in the first position for both countries, the main way for learn in this field is self-taught independing of the country. However the position of the others education types revel that there are some important differences and that reflects the Employment Status analysis. The US labor market is stronger and gives more oportunities to people learn from On-the-job training, while in Brazil it appears only in forth position.

#### _How experienced are the programmers in both countries?_
- The main difference appears when we talk about people with more than 20 years of programming. The US has more than double than Brazil. The other levels has a little vantage for Brazil.

#### _Which developer type is more representative in each country?_ 
- The main tree Developer Types in both countries are Web developer, Desktop applications developer and Mobile developer. The Second and third positions in Brazil has almost the same level, while in United States the difference between these two positions is more evident.

#### _Is there huge differences about formal education among the countries?_
- Most developers in both countries has Bachelor's degree, however in United States it is almost 50%, while in Brazil it is near to 44%. The main difference is in third and fourth position. The US 16,7% has Master's degree and 6,7% Secondary school. In Brazil 16,9% has Secondary school and 12,1% Master's degree.

#### _Which is the most popular course among the developers?_
- Most of the students undergad in Computer science or software engineering in both countries. In Brazil the second position is Computer programming or web development and computer engineering or electrical/electronics engineering appers on the third position.

## Conclusions

- As showed in the representativity of each country, the tech market in Brazil is far away from the United States. It can be seen as a developing market with growing opportunities for Brazilian people, if we adopt the US market as a parameter.

- The labor market in that field suggests that there are more opportunities for full-time jobs and consequently more opportunities to learn on the job in US than in Brazil.

- Both in Brazil and in the US the developers search for knowleg by themselves. However, online course, part-time/evening course and industry certification are more representative in Brazil.

- The Programming Years present the same tendency. With the increas of years programming, the number of workers decrease, but the US is absolutely more experienced when we talk about people with 20 or more years programming

- The Developer Types presents the same tendency in both countries. As the world goes tech, the demands for each developer type gets similar according to the data. The most prominent type was Web developer.

- The Formal Education shows that both nationalities have a Bachelor’s degree and Some college/university study without earning a bachelor’s degree as first and second positions respectively. However, the proportion of people with Secondary school is significantly larger in Brazil than in the US.

- The tech-related majors seem to be more concentrated in Brazil than in the US, except for Computer science or software, that appears in the first position for both contries.
